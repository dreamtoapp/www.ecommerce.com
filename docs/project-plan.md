# Project Plan - www.ecommerce.com

## 🎯 Project Overview
This is a comprehensive e-commerce platform built with Next.js 15.2.1, supporting both Arabic (RTL) and English languages. The platform serves multiple user types: customers, admins, and drivers.

## 🏗️ Architecture Summary
- **Framework**: Next.js 15.2.1 with App Router
- **Language**: TypeScript (strict mode)
- **Database**: MongoDB with Prisma ORM
- **Authentication**: NextAuth.js
- **Styling**: Tailwind CSS + shadcn/ui
- **Internationalization**: next-intl (Arabic primary, English secondary)
- **Image Management**: Cloudinary
- **State Management**: Zustand for client state, React Hook Form for forms

## 📊 Current Status

### ✅ Completed Features
- User authentication system with NextAuth.js
- E-commerce product catalog with categories
- Shopping cart functionality (both local and database)
- Order management system
- Admin dashboard with comprehensive management tools
- Driver interface for order delivery
- Multi-language support (Arabic/English) with RTL
- Image optimization with Cloudinary
- SEO optimization tools
- Promotion/discount system
- User profiles and purchase history

### 🚧 Current Issues (from TypeScript errors)
- Missing module: `app/dashboard/products/actions/index.ts` references non-existent `get-products-by-ids`
- Inconsistent folder naming patterns (component/ vs components/)
- Duplicate cloudinary implementations

### 🔄 Ongoing Work
- Standardizing folder structure across all routes (✅ Started with management-products/new)
- Implementing comprehensive testing framework
- Code quality improvements and TypeScript error resolution
- ✅ Refactored new product page with proper data access layer

## 🎯 Goals & Priorities

### High Priority
1. **Fix TypeScript Errors**: Resolve all module resolution issues
2. **Standardize Folder Structure**: Ensure all routes follow the same pattern
3. **Testing Implementation**: Add Jest/React Testing Library setup
4. **Performance Optimization**: Bundle analysis and optimization

### Medium Priority
1. **Code Deduplication**: Remove duplicate cloudinary implementations
2. **Documentation**: Comprehensive API and component documentation
3. **Security Audit**: Review authentication and data validation
4. **Accessibility**: WCAG compliance improvements

### Future Enhancements
1. **PWA Features**: Offline support and push notifications
2. **Analytics**: Advanced reporting and analytics dashboard
3. **Mobile App**: React Native companion app
4. **AI Features**: Product recommendations and search

## 📋 Technical Debt

### Critical
- TypeScript module resolution errors
- Inconsistent folder naming conventions
- Missing test infrastructure

### Important
- Duplicate code in cloudinary handling
- Scattered documentation across multiple directories
- Missing error boundaries in some routes

### Minor
- Optimization opportunities in bundle size
- Code formatting inconsistencies
- Missing JSDoc comments

## 🔧 Development Workflow

### Branch Strategy
- `main`: Production-ready code
- `develop`: Integration branch for features
- Feature branches: `feature/[feature-name]`

### Code Standards
- TypeScript strict mode enforced
- ESLint + Prettier for code formatting
- Husky for pre-commit hooks
- Conventional commits for git messages

## 📝 Notes
- Arabic is the primary language with RTL support
- Server Components used by default, Client Components only when necessary
- All forms use react-hook-form + zod for validation
- Images optimized through Cloudinary and next/image
