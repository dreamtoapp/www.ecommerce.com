# Registration Flow Debugging Session

## Context

- User reported registration form was not redirecting after successful registration.
- Error message shown: "حدث خطأ غير متوقع أثناء التسجيل. يرجى المحاولة لاحقاً أو التواصل مع الدعم."
- Server logs showed: `Registration error: Error: NEXT_REDIRECT ...` and a 200 POST response.
- The registration action was calling `redirect()` after successful user creation.
- The client form was showing an error message instead of redirecting.

## Diagnosis

- In Next.js App Router, calling `redirect()` in a server action throws a special error (`NEXT_REDIRECT`) to trigger a redirect.
- The client form was catching this error and displaying it as a registration failure, instead of letting the redirect happen.
- Only actual registration failures (validation, duplicate phone, DB errors) should show an error message.

## Fixes Applied

1. **Enhanced Error Handling in Server Action**
   - Show specific validation errors from Zod.
   - Show a clear message for duplicate phone numbers.
   - Show a user-friendly fallback message for unexpected errors.

2. **Fixed Client Form Redirect Handling**
   - Only show error messages if `state.success === false` and `state.message` exists.
   - Do not show an error if registration is successful and a redirect is triggered.
   - Let the `NEXT_REDIRECT` error bubble up so Next.js can handle the redirect.

## Final Solution

- Registration now works as intended:
  - On success, user is redirected to `/user/addresses?welcome=true&message=أضف عنوانك الأول لتسهيل عملية التوصيل`.
  - On failure, user sees a clear, actionable error message.
- The registration flow is now stable and provides a professional UX.
