# Database Maintenance and Schema Change Plan

This document outlines a plan for implementing robust database maintenance procedures and defining a clear process for handling schema changes to ensure the stability, performance, and integrity of the application's data.

## Current Database Setup

The application uses **Prisma** as the ORM with **MongoDB** as the database.

## Proposed Database Maintenance Tasks

The plan focuses on implementing the following database maintenance tasks:

1.  **Schema Validation and Synchronization:**
    *   Implement checks to ensure the application's data adheres to the defined Prisma schema.
    *   Develop procedures for synchronizing the database schema with the Prisma schema, especially after manual database modifications (if any).

2.  **Data Cleanup:**
    *   Identify and implement processes to remove unused, orphaned, or inconsistent data records (e.g., products without a valid supplier, orders without a valid customer).
    *   Define criteria for identifying data that can be safely removed.

3.  **Index Optimization:**
    *   Analyze database query performance to identify areas for index optimization.
    *   Implement procedures for creating, dropping, or modifying indexes to improve read performance.

4.  **Performance Monitoring:**
    *   Integrate tools or scripts to monitor database performance metrics such as query execution times, connection usage, and resource utilization.
    *   Set up alerts for performance degradation.

5.  **Data Backup and Restore:**
    *   Establish automated procedures for creating regular backups of the MongoDB database.
    *   Define and test procedures for restoring the database from backups in case of data loss or corruption.

## Implementation Steps for Maintenance Tasks

1.  **Develop Scripts/Functions:** Create dedicated scripts or functions for each proposed maintenance task (e.g., `cleanupOrphanedRecords.ts`, `optimizeIndexes.ts`). These should be executable independently.
2.  **Integrate with Dashboard:** Integrate these scripts/functions into the `/dashboard/maintenance` page, providing clear UI elements to trigger them.
3.  **Logging and Reporting:** Implement detailed logging for each task execution, including success/failure status, number of records affected, and execution time. Display summaries or logs on the dashboard UI.
4.  **Testing:** Thoroughly test each maintenance task in a staging environment with realistic data volumes before deploying to production.
5.  **Scheduling (Future):** Consider implementing automated scheduling for routine tasks like backups and cleanup in a future iteration.

## Database Schema Change Process

A clear process is essential for managing changes to the database schema:

1.  **Define the Change:** Clearly document the required schema change (e.g., adding a new field to the `Product` model, changing the type of an existing field).
2.  **Update Prisma Schema:** Modify the `prisma/schema.prisma` file to reflect the desired schema change.
3.  **Generate and Apply Migrations:**
    *   Use Prisma Migrate to generate a migration script based on the schema changes (`npx prisma migrate dev`).
    *   Review the generated migration script to understand the changes it will apply.
    *   Apply the migration to the development database.
    *   Ensure the migration can be applied successfully to staging and production environments.
4.  **Update Application Code:** Modify relevant application code (API routes, components, services) to use the new or modified schema fields.
5.  **Testing:** Thoroughly test the application to ensure it functions correctly with the schema changes and that data is handled as expected.
6.  **Deployment:** Deploy the updated code and apply the database migration to staging and then production environments.

## Tools and Technologies

*   **Prisma:** For schema definition and migrations.
*   **MongoDB Tools:** `mongodump` and `mongorestore` for backups and restores.
*   **Custom Scripts:** TypeScript/JavaScript scripts for specific maintenance tasks.

## Discussion Points

*   What is the priority order for implementing the proposed database maintenance tasks?
*   Are there specific data cleanup rules or criteria we should prioritize?
*   What is the preferred strategy for database backups (e.g., frequency, storage location)?
*   Should we integrate a dedicated database monitoring tool?


Let's discuss this plan to ensure it aligns with the project's needs and priorities.
