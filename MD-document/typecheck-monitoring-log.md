## [2025-05-15 15:15] Monitoring Started

- Typecheck monitoring initiated. All actions, errors, and fixes will be recorded here.
- Current status: Outstanding errors in `.next/types` related to missing `setup/page.js` and type mismatch in `[id]/page.tsx`.
- Next step: Clean build artifacts, rebuild, and re-run type checks.

---

## Next Actions
- [x] Clean the `.next/` directory. (DONE)
- [ ] Rebuild the project. (FAILED)
- [ ] Run `pnpm check-types`.
- [ ] Log new errors and resolutions here.

---

## Error Summary (After Clean & Build)
- **Build failed due to missing module:** `@/lib/cloudinary`
    - Affected files:
        - `app/dashboard/categories/actions.ts`
        - `app/dashboard/drivers/actions/Actions.ts`
    - Import traces point to usage in dashboard category and driver pages.
- Previous errors about `.next/types` are not present yet (build did not complete).

---

## Next Actions
- [ ] Restore or create the missing file: `lib/cloudinary.ts` under your project root.
    - If you previously used Cloudinary, restore your integration logic.
    - If not needed, remove or comment out imports and usage in the affected files.
- [ ] Re-run `pnpm build` after fixing the above.
- [ ] Continue monitoring and log new errors or successful build.

_This file will be updated automatically as errors are fixed and new issues are found._
