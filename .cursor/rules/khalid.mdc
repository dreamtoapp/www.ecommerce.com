# Project Structure Rules

## 📁 Folder Organization

- Each route lives in its own folder: `app/[route]/`
  - `components/` → route-specific components
  - `actions/` → server actions
  - `helpers/` → hooks, utils
  - `loading.tsx` → always included, use shadcn skeleton
  - `page.tsx` → always use server components unless needed otherwise

## 🏗️ Feature-Based Structure

- Feature-based folder structure for better organization
- All reusable components/hooks go under `components/ui/` or `lib/hooks/`
- Route-specific components stay in their respective route folders

## 📂 Key Directories

- `app/` - Next.js App Router pages and layouts
- `components/ui/` - Reusable shadcn/ui components
- `lib/` - Utilities, helpers, and shared logic
- `messages/` - Internationalization files (`ar.json`, `en.json`)
- `prisma/` - Database schema and migrations
- `public/` - Static assets

## 🔄 File Naming Conventions

- Use PascalCase for components, pages, and files
- Use camelCase for variables, functions, and folders
- Always include `loading.tsx` for each route
- Use descriptive, semantic names
