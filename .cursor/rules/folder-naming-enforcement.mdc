# 🚨 CRITICAL: Folder Naming Enforcement

**IMMEDIATE ACTION REQUIRED**: This project has critical TypeScript errors due to inconsistent folder naming. You MUST fix these issues as the highest priority.

## 🔥 CRITICAL ISSUES TO FIX NOW

### Current Inconsistencies Found
```
❌ app/(e-comm)/cart/component/          → ✅ should be components/
❌ app/(e-comm)/product/compnent/        → ✅ should be components/ (typo!)
❌ app/(e-comm)/homepage/component/      → ✅ should be components/
❌ app/(e-comm)/about/action/            → ✅ should be actions/
❌ app/(e-comm)/contact/action/          → ✅ should be actions/
```

### TypeScript Module Resolution Error
```
ERROR: app/dashboard/products/actions/index.ts:5:34 
Cannot find module '../../management-products/new/actions/get-products-by-ids'
```

## 🎯 MANDATORY NAMING STANDARDS

### Required Folder Names (EXACT)
- **components/** - React components (PLURAL, never "component")
- **actions/** - Server actions (PLURAL, never "action") 
- **helpers/** - Utilities and hooks (PLURAL)

### Enforcement Rules
1. **IMMEDIATELY rename** any folder that doesn't match these standards
2. **UPDATE all import statements** after renaming
3. **VERIFY TypeScript compilation** after changes
4. **NEVER create** folders with incorrect names

## 🔧 IMMEDIATE FIX PROCEDURE

### Step 1: Rename Folders
```bash
# Fix these folders immediately:
mv app/(e-comm)/cart/component app/(e-comm)/cart/components
mv app/(e-comm)/product/compnent app/(e-comm)/product/components  # Note: fix typo!
mv app/(e-comm)/homepage/component app/(e-comm)/homepage/components
mv app/(e-comm)/about/action app/(e-comm)/about/actions
mv app/(e-comm)/contact/action app/(e-comm)/contact/actions
```

### Step 2: Fix Import Statements
After renaming, update ALL imports that reference these folders:

```typescript
// ❌ OLD (before fix)
import { CartItem } from '../component/CartItem';
import { ProductCard } from '../compnent/ProductCard';

// ✅ NEW (after fix)  
import { CartItem } from '../components/CartItem';
import { ProductCard } from '../components/ProductCard';
```

### Step 3: Fix Missing Module Error
The error `Cannot find module '../../management-products/new/actions/get-products-by-ids'` indicates either:
1. The file doesn't exist at that path
2. The import path is incorrect

**INVESTIGATE AND FIX**:
```typescript
// Check if this file exists:
app/dashboard/management-products/new/actions/get-products-by-ids.ts

// If it doesn't exist, find the correct location or create it
// If it exists elsewhere, fix the import path
```

## 🛡️ PREVENTION RULES

### ESLint Rule (Add to .eslintrc.json)
```json
{
  "rules": {
    "import/no-unresolved": "error"
  }
}
```

### Pre-commit Hook (Recommended)
Create a script to check folder naming before commits:

```bash
#!/bin/bash
# Check for incorrect folder names
if find app -type d -name "component" -o -name "action" -o -name "helper" | grep -q .; then
  echo "❌ ERROR: Found incorrectly named folders!"
  echo "Use: components/, actions/, helpers/ (plural forms)"
  exit 1
fi
```

## 🎯 ROUTE STRUCTURE ENFORCEMENT

### Every Route MUST Have
```
app/[route]/
├── page.tsx                 # ✅ Required
├── loading.tsx              # ✅ Required  
├── components/              # ✅ Required (PLURAL)
│   └── [RouteComponents].tsx
├── actions/                 # ✅ Required (PLURAL)
│   └── [serverActions].ts
└── helpers/                 # ✅ Required (PLURAL)
    └── [utilities].ts
```

### File Creation Commands
When creating new routes, use these exact commands:

```bash
# Create route structure with correct naming
mkdir -p app/new-route/{components,actions,helpers}
touch app/new-route/{page.tsx,loading.tsx}
touch app/new-route/components/.gitkeep
touch app/new-route/actions/.gitkeep  
touch app/new-route/helpers/.gitkeep
```

## 🚨 ZERO TOLERANCE POLICY

### Absolutely Forbidden
- **NEVER** use `component/` (singular)
- **NEVER** use `action/` (singular)  
- **NEVER** use `helper/` (singular)
- **NEVER** create typos like `compnent/`

### Quality Gates
- **MUST** pass TypeScript compilation
- **MUST** have consistent folder naming
- **MUST** update imports when refactoring
- **MUST** verify all modules resolve correctly

## 🔍 VERIFICATION CHECKLIST

After making changes, verify:
- [ ] `npx tsc --noEmit` runs without errors
- [ ] All imports resolve correctly
- [ ] No 404 errors in development server
- [ ] All folder names follow plural convention
- [ ] Git status shows renamed folders, not deleted/created

**This is the highest priority issue. Fix folder naming inconsistencies before any other development work.**
