# To-Do List for Dashboard Performance Optimization

## 1. Data Fetching Optimization
- [ ] Implement Pagination for the `fetchOrders` function (e.g., add `limit` and `offset` parameters).
- [ ] Add Lazy Loading for orders (e.g., infinite scrolling or "Load More" button).
- [ ] Set Up Caching for frequently accessed data (e.g., Redis for analytics or order statuses).

## 2. Reduce Re-Renders
- [ ] Memoize Components like `OrderList`, `OrderCard`, and `DashboardHeader` using `React.memo` or `useMemo`.
- [ ] Implement Virtualization for the order list using libraries like `react-window` or `react-virtualized`.

## 3. Real-Time Updates
- [ ] Optimize Real-Time Updates by fetching only new or updated orders instead of re-fetching all orders.
- [ ] Debounce Updates to reduce frequent re-renders during rapid updates.

## 4. Database Query Optimization
- [ ] Add Indexes to frequently queried fields (e.g., `status`, `createdAt`, `updatedAt`).
- [ ] Use Aggregation Queries for analytics (e.g., `COUNT`, `GROUP BY`) instead of iterating over all orders in the application.

## 5. Component Rendering
- [ ] Add Conditional Rendering for skeleton loaders to avoid rendering the full layout when data is unavailable.
- [ ] Split Large Components like `OrderList` into smaller, focused components.

## 6. Static Asset Optimization
- [ ] Lazy Load Images and icons to reduce the initial load time.
- [ ] Optimize Bundles using Webpack or Vite to tree-shake unused assets.

## 7. State Management
- [ ] Centralize State Management using Redux, Zustand, or Context API for shared states like `viewMode`.
- [ ] Refactor Local States to reduce complexity and improve maintainability.

## 8. Localization
- [ ] Integrate a Localization Library like `i18next` for dynamic translations.
- [ ] Memoize Translation Objects to avoid recalculating them on every render.

## 9. Error Handling
- [ ] Add User-Friendly Error Messages using a toast notification system.
- [ ] Implement Retry Logic for failed API calls to handle transient errors.

## 10. Deployment Optimization
- [ ] Implement Server-Side Rendering (SSR) for components like `DashboardHeader`.
- [ ] Use Static Site Generation (SSG) for static pages like analytics summaries.

## 11. Performance Monitoring
- [ ] Set Up Monitoring Tools like Lighthouse, New Relic, or Datadog to track performance bottlenecks.
- [ ] Add Structured Logging to identify slow database queries and API calls.

## 12. Geospatial Data Refactor
- [ ] Change latitude and longitude fields in your schema from string to Float (or Decimal) for all relevant models (e.g., Order, OrderInWay, Driver, etc.).
- [ ] Update your Prisma schema and run a migration to apply the change.
- [ ] Update all code that reads/writes latitude/longitude to use numbers, not strings.
- [ ] Update seed scripts and API logic to use numbers for lat/lng.
- [ ] Test geospatial features (maps, distance calculations, etc.) to ensure they work with numeric lat/lng.
- [ ] (Optional) Add validation to ensure lat/lng values are within valid ranges (-90 to 90 for latitude, -180 to 180 for longitude).
